expensify
- import tesco expenses from csv
could import by type so can categorise/tag them
or can add extra column to be used for category
- merge expenses
non-merged expenses must be cash
- export to csv
(what about columns for spreadsheet)
could have different tag and use different layout for different tags
expensify has less columns, so might have loss of data
- create report
might want to do this by month so report is not too big

expensify (without importing to expensify)
- export to csv
- process to format suitable for spreadsheet
- merge with expenses csv
- create report
might want to do this by month so report is not too big
